**EMWTINV** is a Python tool for performing **Hybrid Bayesian Inversion (HBI)** for hydrogeophysical data interpretation.

## What is Hybrid Bayesian Inversion (HBI)?

Hybrid Bayesian Inversion (HBI) is a Bayesian extension of Coupled Hydrogeophysical Inversion (CHI) that enables efficient estimation of hydrological properties from geophysical data. It can integrates petrophysical relationships and hydrological models with significant uncertainty in calibration parameters.

HBI decomposes the subsurface model into two components:

* **Groundwater Model**:

  * Predictable using petrophysical and hydrological modeling
  * Characterized by posterior probability density functions (PDFs)

* **Background Model**:

  * Not predictable from petrophysical or hydrological models
  * Represented by deterministic resistivity structures (1D/2D/3D)
  * Its uncertainty is not characterized

This decomposition allows computationally expensive Bayesian inference to be applied only to the groundwater component (which is lower-dimensional), while the background model is handled using conventional least-squares inversion.

### Expectation-Maximization Algorithm

To jointly estimate:

* The posterior PDFs of the **Groundwater Model**
* The maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the **Background Model**

HBI applies the **Expectation-Maximization (EM)** algorithm, where each iteration executes the following sequence:

* **E-step**: Bayesian inversion of the groundwater model using Metropolis-Hastings sampling.
* **M-step**: Least-squares inversion of the background model.

## How It Works

EMWTINV is executed via the `emwtinv_multi.py` script. Example applications are located in the `/Script` directory.

### Directory Structure

* `/Source`: Source code
* `/Script`: Example scripts for applying EMWTINV
* `/Utils`: Tools for plotting and analyzing results

### Configuration Files

Before running, place the following files in the same directory as `emwtinv_multi.py`:

## Running EMWTINV

### Single-process Mode

```bash
python emwtinv_multi.py
```

### Parallel Mode (Linux only)

```bash
mpirun -n <number_of_processes> python -m emwtinv_multi.py
```

> **Note:** Parallel computing is used **only during the E-step** for Bayesian sampling. The total number of samples will be:
>
> `number_of_processes √ó samples_per_process`

Parallelization is implemented via the `mpi4py` library. On Windows, `mpi4py` supports only single-process execution.
